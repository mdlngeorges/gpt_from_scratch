    "- Micrograd will help us implement backpropation. \n",
    "- **Backpropagation** is one of the key building blocks of neural networks - the way I like to think about it is as a math formula that sends a lot of small modifications through your network weights to say _\"hey, this is what I just learned from my mistakes on this training data\"._ \n",
    "- Repeated backpropagation is one of the mechanisms that allows you to learn from large scale of data."
